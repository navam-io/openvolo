# AI Agents and Automation

**Not chatbots. Agents that use tools, take actions, and show their work.**

---

## What an Agent Actually Is

The word "agent" gets thrown around a lot. Most products slap it on a chatbot and call it a day. Simon Willison, one of the sharpest voices in AI tooling, offers a [clear definition](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/17/agents/): "An LLM agent runs tools in a loop to achieve a goal." That's what OpenVolo ships — not conversational widgets, but tool-using AI systems that search the web, scrape profiles, update your CRM, and report what they did.

Benedict Evans at a16z has argued that [AI agents represent the next computing platform](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2024/01/ai-and-everything-else). The bet is that software shifts from "user clicks buttons in a UI" to "user sets a goal and an agent figures out the steps." OpenVolo is built on this premise. The 10 agents it ships aren't features bolted onto a CRM — they're the core architecture. The UI exists to configure, observe, and override them.

## The Agent Gallery

Navigate to **Automation** in the sidebar to see all available agents.

![Automation dashboard — 10 pre-built agents across 6 categories](assets/automation-dashboard.png)
*The Agent Gallery: system agents organized by category (Search, Enrich, Prune, Content, Engage, Outreach) with cost estimates, run counts, and activation buttons.*

Agents are organized into six categories that mirror a typical outreach workflow:

### Search Agents
Discovery — finding new people to add to your CRM.

- **Top AI Influencers** — Finds influential voices in AI/ML on X and LinkedIn. Searches for thought leaders, researchers, and builders across major tech companies and startups. (~$0.50/run)
- **Fintech Leaders** — Discovers leaders in fintech, crypto, and digital banking. Identifies founders, CTOs, and VPs at financial institutions. (~$0.40/run)
- **Developer Advocates** — Finds developer advocates, DevRel professionals, and technical community builders across major tech companies. (~$0.35/run)

### Enrich Agents
Data completion — filling in missing information on existing contacts.

- **Enrich Low-Score Contacts** — Automatically fills in missing data for contacts with low enrichment scores. Searches the web for company, title, location, and social links. (~$0.50/run)
- **Fill Email Gaps** — Finds email addresses for contacts that are missing them. Uses web search to locate professional email patterns. (~$0.40/run)

### Prune Agent
List hygiene — keeping your CRM focused on active, relevant contacts.

- **Prune Inactive Contacts** — Identifies contacts that appear inactive (no social activity, invalid profiles) and recommends them for archival. (~$0.35/run)

### Content Agents
Content creation — generating and publishing posts.

- **Thought Leadership Posts** — Generates and publishes thought leadership content on X and LinkedIn. Creates posts aligned with your brand voice. (~$0.20/run)

### Engage Agents
Relationship building — interacting with your contacts' content.

- **Reply to Mentions** — Monitors and engages with mentions, replies, and tags on X. Uses browser automation to like and reply to relevant conversations. (~$0.15/run)

### Outreach Agents
Cold outreach — making first contact through platform engagement.

- **Cold Intro via Comments** — Builds relationships by engaging with target contacts' posts. Finds posts and leaves thoughtful, relevant comments. (~$0.20/run)

Each agent card shows:
- **Category badge** — Color-coded by type
- **Estimated cost** — Per-run cost based on typical API usage
- **Run history** — Number of previous runs and last execution time
- **Run button** — One-click activation
- **Clone and edit icons** — Customize agents for your specific needs

### System vs. Custom Agents

The gallery has two tabs: **System Agents** (the 10 pre-built ones) and **My Agents**. System agents are templates — you can clone any of them and customize the instructions, target criteria, and behavior for your specific use case. Custom agents inherit the same toolset and execution engine.

## Running an Agent

Click **Run** on any agent card to activate it. The agent goes through a predictable lifecycle:

1. **Thinking** — The LLM reads its instructions and plans its approach
2. **Tool use** — The agent calls tools: web search, browser scrape, contact update, etc.
3. **Iteration** — Based on tool results, the agent decides whether to continue or stop
4. **Completion** — The agent summarizes what it accomplished

Under the hood, agents use Claude via the Vercel AI SDK's `generateText()` with a bounded step count (`stopWhen: stepCountIs(n)`) to prevent runaway loops. Each step is a complete LLM call with tool results fed back in.

### Smart Search Routing

When an agent needs to search the web, OpenVolo's routing engine automatically picks the best provider:

| Agent Type | Primary Provider | Why |
|-----------|-----------------|-----|
| Search agents | Serper | Broad Google results for discovery |
| Enrich agents | Tavily (advanced) | Deep research for person lookup |
| Prune agents | Tavily (basic) | Quick validation of activity |
| Content/Engage | Serper | General web context |

If the primary provider fails or isn't configured, the system automatically fails over to the alternative. You get the best available search without configuring anything.

## Step-Level Observability

Every agent run is fully observable. Click into any completed run to see the detail view.

![Workflow detail — step-by-step timeline of an agent run](assets/workflow-detail.png)
*Workflow detail for "Cold Intro via Comments": 59 steps, 4 contacts processed, 4 successes, completed in 4 minutes 31 seconds.*

The detail page shows:

### Summary Cards
- **Processed** — How many items the agent worked on
- **Success** — Completed successfully
- **Skipped** — Items the agent decided to skip (already enriched, no action needed)
- **Errors** — Failures with error details
- **Duration** — Total wall-clock time

### Step Timeline
Every action the agent took, in chronological order:
- **Thinking** steps — The LLM's reasoning (what it decided to do next)
- **Web Search** — Query, provider, result count, routing reason, failover status, and duration
- **Browser Scrape** — URL visited, title extracted, and scrape duration
- **Contact updates** — Fields modified, enrichment score changes
- **Progress updates** — Running tallies as the agent works

Each step shows its timestamp and duration. You can trace the agent's entire decision chain — why it searched for something, what it found, what it decided to do with the results.

### Timeline vs. Graph View

Toggle between **Timeline** (chronological list) and **Graph** (visual dependency graph) views. The graph shows how steps connect — which searches led to which scrapes, which scrapes led to which contact updates.

## Workflow Scheduling

Agents don't have to be manually triggered. OpenVolo includes a cron-based scheduler that runs agents on a recurring basis.

From the Automation page, click the schedule icon on any agent to configure:

- **Cron presets** — Common schedules: every hour, daily, weekly, monthly
- **Custom cron** — Full cron expression support for precise scheduling
- **Next run preview** — Shows when the agent will next execute
- **Config overrides** — Customize parameters per template type (different search queries, contact filters, etc.)

The scheduler runs on a 60-second interval. When a job is due, it fires the agent workflow and updates the next run time. You can enable/disable individual schedules and see last-triggered timestamps.

This is how you put your CRM on autopilot: schedule the Search agents to discover new contacts weekly, Enrich agents to fill data gaps daily, and Prune agents to clean up monthly.

## Triggering Agents from Chat

Every agent can also be started from the AI Chat Assistant. Open the chat panel (Cmd+K) and say something like:

> "Run the Top AI Influencers search agent"

> "Enrich my low-score contacts"

> "Start a prune workflow"

The chat assistant has a `start_workflow` tool that activates any agent template. This is often the fastest way to run an ad-hoc agent — no clicking through the gallery, just describe what you want.

## Under the Hood: The Agent Toolset

Every agent has access to 10 tools, each doing one thing well:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `search_web` | Searches via Serper or Tavily with smart routing |
| `url_fetch` | Fetches and parses web pages (Cheerio-based) |
| `browser_scrape` | Full browser automation for JS-rendered pages |
| `enrich_contact` | Updates contact fields in the CRM |
| `archive_contact` | Archives contacts (soft delete with metadata) |
| `update_progress` | Reports progress during execution |
| `publish_content` | Publishes posts via browser automation |
| `query_contacts` | Reads contact data from the CRM |
| `query_content` | Reads content library data |
| `query_goals` | Reads goal progress data |

The routing engine decides which tools to use based on the target. X profiles get `browser_scrape` (the API is limited). Wikipedia pages get `url_fetch` (no JS needed). The agent doesn't need to know the routing rules — it just asks to "get information about this person" and the system handles the rest.
