## Features

### Contact Management
Unified contacts across platforms with automatic cross-platform deduplication. Enrichment scoring (0-100) based on profile completeness and identity count, funnel stage tracking from lead to customer.

### X/Twitter Integration
OAuth 2.0 authentication, contact sync from followers/following, tweet and mention import with cursor-based pagination, compose and publish tweets, thread support, and engagement actions (like, retweet, reply).

### LinkedIn Integration
OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect, profile sync, and CSV import for connections (no LinkedIn partner program required).

### Gmail / Google Contacts
Google People API contact sync with 2-tier deduplication (identity match then email match). Email metadata enrichment tracks message frequency (sent/received in last 30 days) per contact — no email content is stored.

### Content Library
Import posts and mentions from X, LinkedIn, and Gmail. Filter by platform to focus on a single channel. Multi-platform compose with platform-aware constraints (X: 280 chars + threads, LinkedIn: 3,000 char drafts). Platform-aware engagement display with per-platform action labels. Six content types (post, thread, article, newsletter, DM, reply). AI-powered draft generation via the `save-draft` agent tool. Engagement metrics tracked over time with both JSON snapshots (fast display) and structured rows (time-series analysis).

### Task Management
Create, update, and track tasks with status and priority. Link tasks to contacts for relationship-aware workflows.

### Automation Hub
Three-tab Automation page — **Agents** (gallery + builder), **Actions** (platform sync operations), **Runs** (execution history). Six workflow types: sync, enrich, search, prune, sequence, and agent. Agent gallery with 10 seed agents (3 search, 3 enrich, 2 prune, plus user-created), activation dialog for quick setup. User agent builder lets you clone any system agent and customize it. Actions tab consolidates all sync operations (X, LinkedIn, Gmail) with platform connection awareness. Four visualization modes (list, kanban, swimlane, graph) with run/step observability and per-step cost tracking. Cron-based workflow scheduling with presets, custom expressions, and a 60-second background runner.

### AI Agent Runner
Eight agent tools — url-fetch (Cheerio), browser-scrape (Playwright), search-web (Serper + Tavily), enrich-contact, update-progress, archive-contact (prune workflows), save-draft (AI content generation), and engage-post (template-driven engagement). Domain-based routing engine (e.g. x.com → browser, wikipedia → fetch) with automatic escalation on failure.

### Prune & Archive
Metadata-based contact archiving from prune workflows — contacts are soft-archived (restorable, not deleted). Archive and restore from workflow detail or individual contact pages. "Show Archived" toggle in the contacts list with visual indicators for archived rows.

### Workflow Scheduling
Cron-based scheduling with common presets (hourly, daily, weekly) and custom cron expressions. Next-run preview and per-template config overrides. Auto-execution via a 60-second background runner initialized through Next.js instrumentation.

### Smart Search
Dual search providers: Serper for broad discovery (Google results), Tavily for deep research. Intelligent routing by workflow type and query patterns with automatic failover. Combined free tiers across both providers.

### Analytics Dashboard
Five-tab dashboard — Overview, Agents, Engagement, Content, Sync Health. Six reusable chart components (area, bar, donut, ranked table, stat cards, skeleton). Time range filtering across all tabs.

### AI Chat Assistant
Streaming chat panel (Cmd+K) powered by Vercel AI SDK 6. Eight CRM tools for querying contacts, analytics, workflows, and content — plus creating contacts, tasks, and starting agents — all conversationally. Page-aware context injection adapts responses to your current view. Smart prompts suggest relevant queries based on your current page. Save conversations and continue them later from the searchable history panel.

### Browser Enrichment
Playwright-based profile scraping with anti-detection measures, LLM-powered field extraction, and session persistence for authenticated scraping.

### Privacy & Security
AES-256 encrypted credential storage. All data stored locally in SQLite — no cloud dependency, no data leaves your machine.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx openvolo
```

On first run, OpenVolo creates `~/.openvolo/` for your database and config, runs schema migrations, and starts the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# Required — for Claude AI features
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

# X/Twitter (optional)
X_CLIENT_ID=
X_CLIENT_SECRET=

# LinkedIn (optional)
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Gmail / Google Contacts (optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Web search (optional — for agent workflows)
SERPER_API_KEY=
TAVILY_API_KEY=
```

## Platform Setup

**X/Twitter** — Create an app at [developer.x.com](https://developer.x.com), enable OAuth 2.0 with `http://localhost:3000/api/platforms/x/callback` as the redirect URI.

**LinkedIn** — Create an app at [developer.linkedin.com](https://developer.linkedin.com), add the "Sign In with LinkedIn using OpenID Connect" product, set `http://localhost:3000/api/platforms/linkedin/callback` as the redirect URI.

**Gmail / Google** — Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com), enable the People API and Gmail API, configure OAuth consent screen, and add `http://localhost:3000/api/platforms/gmail/callback` as the redirect URI.

> See the in-app **Help** page (`/dashboard/help`) for detailed step-by-step setup guides for each platform.

## Architecture

**Boot flow** — `npx openvolo` runs `bin/cli.ts`, which ensures `~/.openvolo/` directories exist, pushes the latest schema to SQLite, and spawns Next.js.

**Rendering boundary** — Server Components read the database directly (better-sqlite3 is synchronous). Client Components call API routes via `fetch`.

**AI** — Vercel AI SDK 6 powers both streaming chat in the UI and background agent workflows using Claude models.

**Data layer** — SQLite database at `~/.openvolo/data.db` managed by Drizzle ORM. Credentials are AES-256 encrypted in `~/.openvolo/config.json`.
